<!--
	The common note elements between cue/grace notes and
	regular (full) notes: pitch, chord, and rest information,
	but not duration (cue and grace notes do not have
	duration encoded here). Unpitched elements are used for
	unpitched percussion, speaking voice, and other musical
	elements lacking determinate pitch.

<!-- Elements -->
<!--
	Notes are the most common type of MusicXML data. MusicXML
	keeps the MuseData distinction between elements used for
	sound information and element used for notation
	information (e.g., tie is used for sound, tied for
	notation). Thus grace notes do not have a duration
	element. Cue notes have a duration element, as do forward
	elements, but no tie elements. Having these two types of
	information available can make interchange considerably
	easier, as some programs handle one type of information
	much more readily than the other.

        Original definition was:

<!ELEMENT note 
   (((grace, %full-note;, (tie, tie?)?) |
    (cue, %full-note;, duration) |
	 (%full-note;, duration, (tie, tie?)?)),
	instrument?, %editorial-voice;, type?, dot*,
	accidental?, time-modification?, stem?, notehead?,
	staff?, beam*, notations*, lyric*)>

	The dynamics and end-dynamics attributes reflect MIDI's
	Note On and Note Off velocities, respectively. They are
	expressed in terms of percentages of a standard MIDI
	forte volume of 90. The attack and release attributes
	are used to alter the staring and stopping time of the
	note from when it would otherwise occur based on the 
	flow of durations - information that is specific to a
	performance. They are expressed in terms of divisions,
	either positive or negative. If a note is played only
	one time through a repeat, the time-only attribute
	shows which time to play the note. The pizzicato 
	attribute is used when just this note is sounded
	pizzicato, vs. the pizzicato and arco elements.

	Pitch is represented as a combination of the step of the
	diatonic scale, the chromatic alteration, and the octave.
	The step element uses the English letters A through G. 
	The alter element represents chromatic alteration in
	number of semitones (e.g., -1 for flat, 1 for sharp).
	Decimal values like 0.5 (quarter tone sharp) may be 
	used for microtones. The octave element is represented
	by the numbers 0 to 9, where 4 indicates the octave
	started by middle C.

	The cue and grace elements indicate the presence of

	note attributes come from MuseData sound suggestions.
	Steal-time-previous indicates the percentage of time
	to steal from the previous note for the grace note.

	The chord element indicates that this note is an

	The unpitched element indicates musical elements that are

	unpitched percussion and speaking voice. Like notes, it
	uses step and octave elements to indicate placement on
	the staff, following the current clef. If percussion clef
	is used, the display-step and display-octave are
	interpreted as if in treble clef, with a G in octave 4 
	on line 2. If not present, the note is placed on the 
	middle line of the staff, generally used for one-line
	staffs.

	specific to an interpretation or performance should use
	the note element's attack and release attributes. The

	The arrow shapes differ from triangle and inverted triangle
	by being centered on the stem. Slashed and back slashed 
	notes include both the normal notehead and a slash. The 
	triangle shape has the tip of the triangle pointing up;
	the inverted triangle shape has the tip of the triangle 
	pointing down.

	needs to be specified with a "yes" value for each beam

	a fan attribute to indicate accelerandos and ritardandos 
	using fanned beams. The fan attribute may also be used
	with a continue value if the fanning direction changes
	on that note. The value is "none" if not specified.
	
	Note that the beam number does not distinguish sets

	A tuplet element is present when a tuplet is to be

	whether the bracket is straight or in the older curved

	Text underlays for lyrics, based on Humdrum with support
	for other formats. The lyric number indicates multiple
	lines, though a name can be used as well (as in Finale's
	verse/chorus/section specification). Word extensions are
	represented using the extend element. Hyphenation is 
	indicated by the syllabic element, which can be single, 
	begin, end, or middle. These represent single-syllable
	words, word-beginning syllables, word-ending syllables,
	and mid-word syllables. Multiple syllables on a single
	note are separated by elision elements. A hyphen in the
	text element should only be used for an actual hyphenated
	word. Humming and laughing representations are taken from
	Humdrum. The end-line and end-paragraph elements come
	from RP-017 for Standard MIDI File Lyric meta-events;
	they help facilitate lyric display for Karaoke and
	similar applications. Language names for text elements
	come from ISO 639, with optional country subcodes from
	ISO 3166. Justification is center by default; placement is
	below by default.

	Figured bass elements take their position from the first
	regular note that follows. Figures are ordered from top to
	bottom. A figure-number is a number. Values for prefix and
	suffix include the accidental values sharp, flat, natural,
	double-sharp, flat-flat, and sharp-sharp. Suffixes include
	both symbols that come after the figure number and those 
	that overstrike the figure number. The suffix value slash
	is used for slashed numbers indicating chromatic alteration.
	The orientation and display of the slash usually depends on
	the figure number. The prefix and suffix elements may 
	contain additional values for symbols specific to particular
	figured bass styles. The value of parentheses is "no" if not
	present.

	Forward is generally used within voices and staves,
	while backup to move between voices and staves. Thus

	elements. Duration values should always be positive,
