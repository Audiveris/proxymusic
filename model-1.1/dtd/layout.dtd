<!--
	MusicXML 1.1 adds layout information for pages,
	systems, staffs, and measures. These layout elements 
	join the print and sound elements in providing 
	formatting data as elements rather than attributes.

	Everything is measured in tenths of staff space.
	Tenths are then scaled to millimeters within the
	scaling element, used in the defaults element at
	the start of a score. Individual staves can apply
	a scaling factor to adjust staff size. When a
	MusicXML element or attribute refers to tenths,
	it means the global tenths defined by the scaling
	element, not the local tenths as adjusted by the
	staff-size element.
-->

<!-- Elements -->

<!--
	Margins, page sizes, and distances are all measured in
	tenths to keep MusicXML data in a consistent coordinate
	system as much as possible. The translation to absolute
	units is done in the scaling element, which specifies
	how many millimeters are equal to how many tenths. For
	a staff height of 7 mm, millimeters would be set to 7
	while tenths is set to 40. The ability to set a formula
	rather than a single scaling factor helps avoid roundoff
	errors.

	Page layout can be defined both in score-wide
	defaults and in the print element. Page margins
	are specified either for both even and odd pages,
	or via separate odd and even page number values.
	The type is not needed when used in as part of
	a print element. If omitted when used in the
	defaults element, "both" is the default.

        Original definition was:

	page-margins?, page-margins?)>

<!--
	System layout includes left and right margins and the
	vertical distance from the previous system. Margins 
	are relative to the page margins. Positive values 
	indent and negative values reduce the margin size.
	The system distance is measured from the bottom line
	of the previous system to the top line of the current
	system. It is ignored for the first system on a page.
	The top system distance is measured from the page's
	top margin to the top line of the first system. It is 
	ignored for all but the first system on a page.

<!--
	Staff layout includes the vertical distance from
	the bottom line of the previous staff in this system
	to the top line of the staff specified by the number
	attribute. The first staff of the part is used if
	the number attribute is missing. When used in the
	defaults element, the values apply to all parts.
	This value is ignored for the first staff in a system.

<!--
	Measure layout includes the horizontal distance 
	from the previous measure. This value is only used
	for systems where there is horizontal whitespace 
	in the middle of a system, as in systems with codas.
	To specify the measure width, use the width attribute
	of the measure element.
