<!--
	MusicXML is designed to represent musical scores,
	specifically common western musical notation from the
	17th century onwards. It is designed as an interchange
	format for notation, analysis, retrieval, and performance
	applications. Therefore it is intended to be sufficient,
	not optimal, for these applications.
	
	MusicXML is based on the MuseData and Humdrum formats.
	Humdrum explicitly represents the two-dimensional nature
	of musical scores by a 2-D layout notation. Since XML
	is a hierarchical format, we cannot do this explicitly.
	Instead, there are two top-level formats:
	
	partwise.dtd   Represents scores by part/instrument
	timewise.dtd   Represents scores by time/measure
	
	Thus partwise.dtd contains measures within each part,
	while timewise.dtd contains parts within each measure.
	XSLT stylesheets are provided to convert between the
	two formats.
	
	The partwise and timewise score DTDs represent a single 
	movement of music. Multiple movements or other musical 
	collections are presented using opus.dtd. An opus
	document contains XLinks to individual scores.
	
	Suggested use:
	
	<!DOCTYPE score-partwise PUBLIC
		"-//Recordare//DTD MusicXML 1.1 Partwise//EN"
		"http://www.musicxml.org/dtds/partwise.dtd">
	
	This DTD is made up of a series of component DTDs, all
	of which are included here.

<!-- Entities -->

<!--
	The partwise and timewise entities are used with
	conditional sections to control the differences between
	the partwise and timewise DTDs. The values for these
	entities are what distinguish the partwise and timewise
	DTD files.
-->

<!ENTITY % timewise "IGNORE">
