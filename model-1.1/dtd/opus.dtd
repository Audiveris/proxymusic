<!--
	An opus collects MusicXML scores together into a larger
	entity. The individual scores could be movements in a
	symphony, scenes or acts in an opera, or songs in an
	album. The opus definition allows arbitrary nesting
	either via an opus (included in the document) or an
	opus-link (linked like scores). Future versions of
	MusicXML may expand this DTD to include reference
	data and other metadata related to musical scores.

<!-- Elements -->

<!--
	Opus is the document element.
-->
<!ELEMENT opus (title?, (opus | opus-link | score)*)>

<!--
	Scores provide the links to the individual movements.
-->
<!ELEMENT score EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST score %link-attributes;>

<!--
	An opus-link provides a link to another opus document,
	allowing for multiple levels of opus collections via
	linking as well as nesting.
-->
<!ELEMENT opus-link EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST opus-link %link-attributes;>

<!--
	Future versions may include metadata elements. In
	this version, we just include the title of the opus.
