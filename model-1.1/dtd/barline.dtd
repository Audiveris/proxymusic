<!--
	If a barline is other than a normal single barline, it
	should be represented by a barline element that describes
	it. This includes information about repeats and multiple
	endings, as well as line style. Barline data is on the
	same level as the other musical data in a score - a child
	of a measure in a partwise score, or a part in a timewise
	score. This allows for barlines within measures, as in
	dotted barlines that subdivide measures in complex
	meters. The two fermata elements allow for fermatas
	on both sides of the barline (the lower one inverted).
	
	Barlines have a location attribute to make it easier to
	process barlines independently of the other musical data
	in a score. It is often easier to set up measures
	separately from entering notes. The location attribute
	must match where the barline element occurs within the
	rest of the musical data in the score. If location is
	left, it should be the first element in the measure; if
	location is right, it should be the last element. If no
	location is specified, the right barline is the default.

        Original definition was:
<!ELEMENT barline (bar-style?, %editorial;, wavy-line?, 
	segno?, coda?, (fermata, fermata?)?, ending?, repeat?)>

<!--
	Endings refers to multiple (e.g. first and second)
	endings. Typically, the start type is associated with
	the left barline of the first measure in an ending. The
	stop and discontinue types are associated with the right
	barline of the last measure in an ending. Stop is used
	when the ending mark concludes with a downward jog, as
	is the case for first endings. Discontinue is used when
	there is no downward jog, as in the final ending. The 
	length of the jog can be specified using the end-length
	attribute. The number attribute reflects what is under 
	the ending line. Single endings such as "1" or multiple
	endings such as "1, 2" may be used. The ending element 
	text is used when the text displayed in the ending is
	different than what appears in the number attribute.

	Repeat marks. The start of the repeat has a forward
	direction while the end of the repeat has a backward
	direction. Backward repeats that are not part of an
	ending can use the times attribute to indicate the
	number of times the repeated section is played.
