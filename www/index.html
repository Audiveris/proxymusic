		14-Jan-2007, under the GPL v2 license.

	    <h3>Project Goals</h3>
	    
	    <p> <b>ProxyMusic</b> provides a binding between <b>Java
		objects</b> in memory and an XML file using
		the <b>MusicXML V1.1</b> format. It should provide an
		easy way for Java programs dealing with music
		information (such as score scanners, music editors,
		music sequencers, etc) to read or write files in
		MusicXML.</p>
	    <p> The binding is made available for any Java application
		as a dedicated jar file.</p>
	    
	    <h3>Requirements</h3>

	    <p> <b>JAXB2</b> is needed at run-time to perform
		marshalling or unmarshalling. If you are using the
		latest Java version (<b>Java 6</b> as recently
		released), JAXB2 is already included in the Java
		distribution. If you are using Java 5, you will need
		to download a separate JAXB2 implementation (such as
		2.0.4 or 2.1), from <a
		href="https://jaxb.dev.java.net/">Jaxb web
		site</a>. And since generics are used by the binding,
		you should forget about Java 1.4.</p>

	    <p> If you want to rebuild the binding, besides JAXB2,
		you'll need a tool to generate an XML schema from the
		original DTD files. JAXB2 is not currently able to do
		the job, but you can use a small utility
		called <b>dtd2xs</b>, free for non-commercial use,
		that is available on <a
		href="http://www.syntext.com/products/index.htm">Syntext
		site</a>.

		<ul>
		    <li class="leafnode"> The <a
			href="https://proxymusic.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=0">
			download area</a>&nbsp;contains the latest
			stable release. On this area you'll find:</li>
		    <ul>
			<li> The binding jar
			file <b>proxymusic-1.1.jar</b>. This is the
			only file you actually need to just use the
			binding.</li>
			<li> If you are using an IDE such as NetBeans,
			you should be interested in feeding the IDE
			with two related archives: the
			javadoc <b>proxymusic-1.1-doc.jar</b> and the
			source <b>proxymusic-1.1-src.jar</b>.</li>
			<li>If you want to regenerate the binding (for
			version V1.1 of MusicXML or for another one),
			here is the core
			material <b>proxymusic-core.zip</b>. Or if you
			prefer everything baked, get
			<b>proxymusic-pack.zip</b>.</li>
		    </ul>
		    <li class="leafnode"> The <a
			href="https://proxymusic.dev.java.net/source/browse/proxymusic/">
			CVS repository</a> can be accessed to retrieve
			any version of all software pieces.</li>

	    <h3>Documentation</h3>

		    <dl>
			<dt><b>Use</b> of the binding</dt>
			<dd class="leaf">A small <a
			    href="https://proxymusic.dev.java.net/source/browse/proxymusic/src/test/proxymusic/util/HelloWorld.java?rev=HEAD&view=auto&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">
			    example</a>&nbsp;is available in the Test
			    repository, performing marshalling and
			    unmarshalling of the classical HelloWorld
			    as available in the MusicXML
			    tutorial.</dd>
			<dt><b> Regeneration</b> of the binding</dt>
			<dd class="leaf">A detailed <a
			    href="recipy.html">recipy</a> is provided,
			    that describes the proper sequence of
			    steps, manual and automatic. Note that the
			    regeneration of the binding is not a
			    mandatory task as the jar file from the
			    download area can be used as is.
			    <p> In short, the binding is generated
				from the original set of DTD files
				found on <a
				href="http://www.recordare.com/xml.html">Recordare
				web site</a>. A few manual
				modifications have to be done in the
				DTD files as described in the recipy,
				and the rest of the generation is
				performed automatically via an 'ant'
				build file (or via a NetBeans
				project). The resulting 300+ Java
				files use the JAXB2 binding for
				marshalling and unmarshalling. The
				comments found in the original DTD
				files are also copied into the proper
				Java files.</p>

	    <h3>Current Status</h3>

	    <p>	ProxyMusic is available today in version 1.1, since it
		uses the MusicXML version 1.1. </p>
	    <p>	When the new MusicXML version (V1.2) gets published,
		one can expect that a proxymusic version 1.2 will be
		easily generated.</p>
	    
	    <h3>Foreseen Contributions</h3>

	    <p>	This work started as a companion of <a
		href="https://audiveris.dev.java.net">Audiveris</a>
		project, for which I needed a suitable binding to
		write MusicXML. After a few discussions on MusicXML
		forum, especially the help provided by Dominik
		Wei-Fieg,&nbsp;I developed this binding, documented
		the process, and made the result available as a
		project separate from Audiveris.</p>

	    <p>	Through Audiveris, I use this binding for marshalling
		only, and my experience as an end-user is
		satisfactory. The unmarshalling aspect has not been
		thoroughly tested and would benefit&nbsp;from
		another&nbsp;project interested in unmarshalling
		MusicXML files to Java.</p>
