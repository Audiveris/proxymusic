                <p>On 21-may-2012, the marshalled encoding date field now 
                    strictly matches the "YYYY-MM-DD" format, with no additional
                    time information. Thanks to lasconic@gmail.com for the patch.
                <br/>
                ProxyMusic switched to Java 7.</p>
                    
		<p>On 14-oct-2011, UTF8 encoding was enforced for the MusicXML
                    stream output. Before that, the encoding was by default the
                one selected for the current platform.</p>
		
		<p>On 22-Jun-2009, the schema definitions for
		    'metronome', 'lyric' and 'note' were simplified in order to
		    avoid JAXB to generate catch-all collections.</p>
		
		<p>On 28-Apr-2009, ProxyMusic license switched
		    from GPL to LGPL. Java classes were built with JAXB 2.1.3 tools.</p>
		
		<p>On 12-Nov-2008, ProxyMusic was updated to generate MusicXML
		    Java bindings directly from the <span style="font-weight:
		    bold;">schema</span> definition, rather than from the
		    initial DTD files.</p>

	    <h3>Project Management</h3>

	    <p>On <a href="http://kenai.com/projects/proxymusic/">
		      http://kenai.com/projects/proxymusic/</a> you'll find all
		      related management features (source code, mailing list,
		      download area, etc).</p>
	    
	    
	    <h3>Project Goals</h3>
	    
	    <p> <b>ProxyMusic</b> provides a binding between <b>Java objects</b>
		in memory and an XML file using the <b>MusicXML</b> format. It
		should provide an easy way for Java programs dealing with music
		symbolic information (such as score scanners, music editors,
		music sequencers, etc) to read or write files in MusicXML. It is
		released under the GNU Lesser Public License.</p>
	    <p>The binding is made available for any Java application as a
		dedicated jar file, which handles the latest version of
		MusicXML: 2.0</p>
	    <p></p>
	    
	    <h3>Requirements</h3>
	    
	    <p> <b>JAXB2</b> is needed at run-time to perform marshalling or
		unmarshalling.
	    </p>
	    
	    <ul>
		<li>The released ProxyMusic binary is produced by <b>Java 7</b>
                    and JAXB2 is already included in the Java
		    distribution.</li>
		
		<li>You can also use <b>Java 6</b> and recompile the sources.
                    (JAXB2 is also included in the Java 6 distribution)</li>
		
		<li>If you are using Java 5, you will need to download a
		    separate JAXB2 implementation, from the <a
		    href="https://jaxb.dev.java.net/">JAXB web site</a>.</li>
		
		<li>And since generics are used by the binding, you should
		    forget about Java 1.4.</li>

	    <h3>Current Status</h3>
	    
	    <p>
		ProxyMusic is available today in version 2.0 to support the
		corresponding version of MusicXML. The binding uses JAXB version
		2.0 as available in Java 7.<br/>  If a user wants to handle a
		file in an older MusicXML version, he will simply need to use
		XSLT with the proper xls conversion file available on Recordare
		web site.</p>
	    <p>
		The <a
			href="http://kenai.com/projects/proxymusic/sources/hg/content/src/main/proxymusic/util/Marshalling.java">proxymusic.util.Marshalling</a>
			provides overloaded versions of a marshal method to
		handle output as: file, output stream or DOM node.</p>
	    
	    <h3>Foreseen Contributions</h3>
	    
	    <p>
		This work started as a companion of a another project whose name
		is <a href="http://audiveris.kenai.com">Audiveris</a> , for
		which I needed a suitable binding to write MusicXML. After a few
		discussions on MusicXML forum, especially the help provided by
		Dominik Wei-Fieg, I developed this binding, documented the
		process, and made the result available as a project separate
		from Audiveris.</p>
	    
	    <p> Through Audiveris, I use this binding for marshalling only, and
		my experience as an end-user is satisfactory. The unmarshalling
		aspect has not been thoroughly tested and would benefit from
		another project interested in unmarshalling MusicXML files to
		Java.</p>
