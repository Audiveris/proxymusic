	    <div class="donemessage">A new version of ProxyMusic has been
		released on 10-Apr-2007, to support MusicXML V2.0 (beta).
	    </div>
	    
	    <h3>Project Goals</h3>
	    
	    <p> <b>ProxyMusic</b> provides a binding between <b>Java objects</b>
		in memory and an XML file using the <b>MusicXML</b> format. It
		should provide an easy way for Java programs dealing with music
		symbolic information (such as score scanners, music editors,
		music sequencers, etc) to read or write files in MusicXML. It is
		released under the GNU Public License version 2.</p>
	    <p> The binding is made available for any Java application as a
		dedicated jar file. There is one jar file per supported version
		of MusicXML:
		<ul>
		    <li>MusicXML V1.1</li>
		    <li>MusicXML V2.0 (beta)</li>
		</ul>
	    </p>
	    
	    <h3>Requirements</h3>

	    <p> <b>JAXB2</b> is needed at run-time to perform marshalling or
		unmarshalling.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you are using the latest Java version (<b>Java 6</b>
			as recently released), JAXB2 is already included in the
			Java distribution.</li>
		    <li>If you are using Java 5, you will need to download a
			separate JAXB2 implementation, from the <a
			href="https://jaxb.dev.java.net/">JAXB web
			site</a>.</li>
                    <li>And since generics are used by the binding, you should
			forget about Java 1.4.</li>
		</ul>
	    </p>
	    
	    <p> If ever you want to rebuild the binding by yourself, besides
		JAXB2, you'll need a tool to generate an XML schema from the
		original DTD files. JAXB2 is not currently able to do the job,
		but you can use a small utility called <b>dtd2xs</b>, free for
		non-commercial use, that is available on <a
		href="http://www.syntext.com/products/index.htm">Syntext
		site</a>.

			<dt><b>Use</b> of the binding</dt>
			<dd class="leaf">A small example is available in two
			    versions in the <b>proxymusic.examples</b>
			    package. There are actually two examples <a
			    href="https://proxymusic.dev.java.net/source/browse/proxymusic/src/main/proxymusic/examples/HelloWorld_2_0.java?rev=HEAD&view=markup">HelloWorld_2_0.java</a>
			    and <a
			    href="https://proxymusic.dev.java.net/source/browse/proxymusic/src/main/proxymusic/examples/HelloWorld_1_1.java?rev=HEAD&view=markup">HelloWorld_1_1.java</a>
			    since there are slight differences in the user
			    program implied by V1.1 and V2.0. This example
			    performs marshalling and unmarshalling of the
			    classical HelloWorld as available in the MusicXML
			    tutorial.
			    <p>A utility class
				<a
				href="https://proxymusic.dev.java.net/source/browse/proxymusic/src/main/proxymusic/util/Marshalling.java?rev=HEAD&view=markup">proxymusic.util.Marshalling</a>
				is available to simplify the handling of both
				marshalling and unmarshalling.</p></dd>
			<dt><b> Regeneration</b> of the binding</dt>
			<dd class="leaf"> Note that the regeneration of the
			    binding is not a mandatory task as the jar file from
			    the download area can be used as is.  A detailed <a
			    href="recipy.html">recipy</a> is however provided,
			    that describes the proper sequence of steps (all the
			    steps are now performed automatically).
			    <p> In short, the binding is generated from the
				original set of DTD files found on <a
				href="http://www.recordare.com/xml.html">
				Recordare web site</a>. A few modifications are
				performed on the DTD files, the corresponding
				schema is generated and corrected and finally
				the various Java classes are generated. These
				steps are carried out automatically via an 'ant'
				build file (or via a NetBeans project). The
				resulting 300+ Java files use the JAXB2 binding
				for marshalling and unmarshalling. The comments
				found in the original DTD files are also copied
				into the proper Java files.</p>

	    <h3>Current Status</h3>

	    <p> ProxyMusic is available today in version 1.1 and version 2.0
		beta to support the corresponding versions of MusicXML.</p>
	    <p> The modifications needed for MusicXML V2.0 have also been the
		opportunity to implement a more automated way for generating the
		various artifacts of the binding, which have been retrofitted in
		V1.1 as well.</p>
	    
	    <h3>Foreseen Contributions</h3>

	    <p> This work started as a companion of <a
		href="https://audiveris.dev.java.net">Audiveris</a> project, for
		which I needed a suitable binding to write MusicXML. After a few
		discussions on MusicXML forum, especially the help provided by
		Dominik Wei-Fieg, I developed this binding, documented the
		process, and made the result available as a project separate
		from Audiveris.</p>

	    <p> Through Audiveris, I use this binding for marshalling only, and
		my experience as an end-user is satisfactory. The unmarshalling
		aspect has not been thoroughly tested and would benefit from
		another project interested in unmarshalling MusicXML files to
		Java.</p>
